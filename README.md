# Popular Movies App
This app was built as an Udacity Nanodegree class project. It allows
users to view and rate popular movies.

## API Key Usage
The api keys are expected to be in app/src/main/res/values/secrets.xml
Here is the format to insert your own:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!-- Don't forget this is in res/values/secrets.xml-->
<resources>
    <string name="tmdb_api_key_v3">INSERT_V3_KEY_HERE</string>
    <string name="tmdb_api_key_v4">INSERT_V4_KEY_HERE</string>
</resources>
```
